# str_to_word_array

## Introduction

During your first year at my school, we all learn C from the bottom.<br>
The goal is to learn the basics of programmation which is why often, you can't use most of the libC functions.
So yes it means you'll have to code your own ;)

## The Function

String To Word Array. It splits a given string depending on given separators into a two dimensional array. <br>
We're asked to code this function early in the year, it is hard at the moment but it comes very handy for the upcoming projects.<br><br>

Here are some challenges it presents: double pointers, string handling, coding style, memory leaks.<br>
I'm pretty sure I wasn't able to do one that passed all these challenges at the time.<br><br>

Finally, here's my take at it, giving my current best with some bonus unit tests with Criterion.

## Tests

To start my simple tests:<br>
```sh
make tests_run
```
